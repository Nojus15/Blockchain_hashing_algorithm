## Idea

General idea for this hashing algorithm revolves around using `XOR` and `bit rotations`.

```
Function hashString(string str)
    Calculates random seed used later for bitflips and picking hash start position.
    Converts provided string to binary.

    Make binary string multiple of 512:
        bitsToAdd = calc bits needed to add
        if there are some bits that needs to be added then the first bit added is 1 and the rest are 0.
    End

    ModifyAddedZeros() -- main hashing function that has most shuffling logic
        Make some random bit flips by seed calculated at the start.

        For i = 0 to length of binary string, i += 32
            t1 = make rotation of substr of binarystring of 32 XOR make rotation of substr of binarystring of 32 XOR shift substr of binarystring of 32
            t2 = make rotation of substr of binarystring of 32 XOR make rotation of substr of binarystring of 32 XOR shift substr of binarystring of 32
            make random bitflips for t1 and t2
            s1 = binary string of 32 get by adding substring of binaryString and t1
            s2 = binary string of 32 get by adding substring of binaryString and t2
            binaryString.replace 32 bits in random pos with s1+s2
        EndOfFor
    End

    ConvertBinaryToHex()
        picks position in the binaryString by seed calculated at the start.
        start position varies from 0 to binaryString.length - 256 - 1 (to make 64 hex we need 256 bits)
        convert to hex using std::hex and bitset. Since max bitset is 64 it converts in 4 times by 64. 
        (if 64 bits block starts with 4,8,12... number of "0" then std:: hex ignores them and hash length reduces so if 64 bits block start with 0000 it is replaced to 1000)
    End
EndOfAlgorithm
```
## Performance

| String length   | 0.00040018 | 0.00169992 | 0.0151998 | 0.148316 | 1.466   | 14.5891   |
|-----------------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|  
| Time in seconds | 100	       | 1000	    | 10000	    | 100000   | 1000000 |	10000000 |

## Strengths and weaknesses

The strengths:
- Algorithm complexity â€“ O(n)
- generated hashes are collision resistant: generating 2M strings, hashing then and comparing all has 0 collisions
- on average two hashes differ<sup>1</sup> from each other by ~86,1%

The weaknesses:
- algorithm could be faster
- minimum difference of 2 hashes is 68,7%
- test are inefficient so it takes a lot of time

<sup>1</sup> - difference is measured using Levenshtein distance algorithm, e.g. two strings "aa" and "ab" differ by 50% because one operation is required to make them equal.
